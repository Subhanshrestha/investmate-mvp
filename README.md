- Screenshots

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js (react-chartjs-2)

- State management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Architecture: Container/Presenter pattern (QuizContainer vs QuizForm)

## Project Structure
```
investmate-mvp/
  client/                # React + Tailwind + Chart.js
  server/                # Express + MongoDB + Mongoose
  README.md
  .gitignore
  demo-script.md
```

## Installation & Running Locally

### 1) Backend
```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env     # Add your MongoDB connection string
npm install
npm run dev              # Runs on http://localhost:4000
```

### 2) Frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev              # Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

The client assumes API URL http://localhost:4000 by default. You can override via `VITE_API_URL` in `client/.env` if needed.
